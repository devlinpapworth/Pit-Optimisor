Name, Hardness, Color, Streak, Prominent Cleavage, Composition, Other Properties,
Molybdenite, 1-1.5, Lead-gray, greenish to bluish gray, YES - 1 dir. (platy), MoS2, Greasy feel; flexible plates
Graphite, 1, steel-gray to black, gray to black, YES - 1 dir. (platy), C, Greasy feel; flexible plates
Covellite, 1.5-2, indigo-blue, gray to black, YES - 1 dir. (platy), CuS, Iridescent yellow and red
Galena, 2.5, Gray, gray, YES - 3 dir. at 90, PbS, High specific gravity
Chalcocite,	2.5-3, black to lead gray, black to lead gray, NO, Cu2S, (Brittle, high specific gravity)
Bornite, 3, bronze but with copper-red to purplish iridescence,	grayish black, No, Cu5FeS4,	Also known as peacock ore.
Chalcopyrite, 3.5-4, brassy yellow usually tarnished, greenish black, No, CuFeS2, (Softer than pyrite; most common copper mineral)
Limonite (Goethite), 4-5.5, (Yellow-brown, orange-brown, dark brown), yellowish brown to reddish, No, HFeO2, (Mixture of rust-like iron oxides. Mostly mineral "goethite." Earthy to metallic luster. Stalactitic, botryoidal forms common.)
Hematite, 5.5-6.5, Steel-gray to reddish brown, reddish brown, No, Fe2O3, (Most common iron mineral; specular hematite variety is composed of fine silvery flakes)
Magnetite, 5.5-6.5, Black, black, NO (but sometimes shows parting), Fe3O4, (Strongly magnetic; lodestone variety shows polarity; often in octahedral (8-sided) crystals)
Pyrite, 6-6.5, Pale brassy yellow, greenish to brownish black, No, FeS2, (Known as Fool's Gold. Brittle, common in crystals, but also granular and massive (no obvious form)).
